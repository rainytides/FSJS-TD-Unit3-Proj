 Treehouse techdegree third project

 
=======
 This is the third project for the Treehouse techdegree requirement. It is an interactive form that helps a user sign up for a multi-day, multi-session conference and provide payment using different options.

**Real-Time Error Messages**
1. As part of enhancing the user experience, real-time validation on form fields has been implemented. As soon as a user starts typing or modifies the input content, immediate feedback is provided.
2. This feature helps users correct errors on-the-fly, without having to wait until form submission to see what went wrong. One area where it is super useful is the email address section.

****Conditional Error Message for Email Field**
1. To assist users in providing the correct information, conditional error messages for the email input field was added.
2. If the email field is left empty, a prompt reminds the user to provide an email address.
3. If an incorrectly formatted email address is entered, such as missing an "@" symbol or a domain, the system provides a specific message guiding the user to correct the mistake.
